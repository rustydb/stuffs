Our programs works as follows:

We start by reading everything from the given clients.txt into a shared queue.
Each line is in its own node in the queue. We start our threads, defaulting to 5
if none are specified, and each thread runs threader. Threader establishes a mutex
lock. Thus allowing it to deque, decrypt, and write to the shared log file without
issue. In addition (but not needed by the mutex_lock), it writes the client.out files.

Important:
When retrieve.out is ran, it will change into the directory of argv[1] (clients.txt).

Check comments for specific details.
