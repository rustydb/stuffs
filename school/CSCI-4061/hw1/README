Our code doesn't rely on a data structure, but rather recursively uses parse_file to locate the targets we need and run the commands in the correct order. 
This is done in the following steps:


1. Locate the target we are searching for (in the first call, this will be the target received from the command line, if none given defaults to "all")

2. Find the dependencies after the ":" listed for each target and call parse_file with each dependency

3. Execute any terminal commands following your target until reaching "end" or EOF
