Subject: Welcome to 4L!

Welcome, $NAME!

Your username is: $NEWUSER
Your password is: $PASSWORD

You will be asked to change your password after you log in. 

You can use putty or MobaXterm to make a Secure Shell (ssh) to the server. Putty is more light weight, but MobaXterm does a lot of heavy lifting for you.

Both applications have 'pen' drive versions for running them off a flash drive on any PC.

--------------------------------------------------

*SSH in and change your password before attempting to use any other services. If you have issues let me know at rdbunch93@gmail.com.*

4L Server Info
Main Host       : fruitloop
Domain          : 4lambda.io
Website         : www.4lambda.io (Currently up but under construction)
FTP             : ftp://fruitloop.4lambda.io (Paste this into your web browser to download your files)
SFTP            : sftp://fruitloop.4lambda.io (Use this to securely connect with FileZilla or another sFTP client)

For an FTP client, I recommend FileZilla Client. It can also be installed to a flash drive.

--------------------------------------------------

To log in to the server, use the following command:
> ssh $NEWUSER@fruitloop.4lambda.io

If you want to run anything graphical, you need to "forward X" by using:

$> # Linux
$> ssh -XC $NEWUSER@fruitloop.4lambda.io
$> # OS X
$> ssh -YC $NEWUSER@fruitloop.4lambda.io

The -X (or -Y) is to forward X11 (for opening windows remotely) and -p specifies the port number. The -C allows for compression and in theory should speed up rendering over slower connections.

News emails will be sent out occasionally when system downtime is planned, upgrades are coming in, or other news. Often times I will have a For the Curious (FTC) section with some more background info on things, for the curious folk. Example:
